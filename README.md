# Learn Object Oriented Programming in Python - Library Management System




**Objective:** Create a basic system to manage books within a library, incorporating basic OOP principles.

**Features:**
- **Class Design:** Define classes such as `Book`, `Member`, and `Librarian`. Each class should have relevant attributes (e.g., `Book` might have `title`, `author`, and `isbn`).


- **Inheritance:** Create a subclass `DigitalBook` that inherits from `Book`, adding digital-specific properties like `filesize` or `format`.


- **Methods and Encapsulation:** Implement methods to manage book checkouts, returns, and status updates, ensuring that all sensitive data is protected with appropriate access modifiers.


- **Practical Use of Polymorphism:** Utilize method overriding to customize behavior for digital versus physical books, such as a download method for `DigitalBook`.
